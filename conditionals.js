// ex1
//const raining = true;
// const cold = true;

// if (raining) {
//   console.log("Don't forget your umbrella!");
// }

// if (cold) {
//   console.log("Make sure you pick out a scarf!");

// console.log("Now you're ready to go outside!");

// But what if we wanted to do one thing in one case and another in all other cases?
// const cold = false;

// if (cold) {
//   console.log("Make sure you pick out a scarf!");
// } else {
//   console.log("Short sleeves are fine.");
// }

// Now, because cold is false, the console.log within our if statement will 
//not be executed, but the code inside the else block will. If cold were true,
// the opposite would happenâ€”that is, the program would tell us to choose a
// scarf to wear but it won't tell us short sleeves are OK.

//ex3

const temperature = 16;

if (temperature < 0) {
  console.log("Make sure you pick out a scarf!");
} else if (temperature < 15) {
  console.log("Short sleeves won't cut it!");
} else {
  console.log("Short sleeves are fine.");
}

console.log("Now you're ready to go outside!");

//explained
//This looks a lot more complicated, so let's go through it step by step. 
//Our first if condition is whether temperature is less than 0. If that 
//condition evaluates to true, then JavaScript will tell us to wear a scarf 
//before telling us to go outside. If this first if condition is false, then 
//JavaScript will jump to the next else if condition, that is whether 
//temperature is less than 15. In our case this is the first condition that
// is true, and so this is what was logged to our console. If, however,
// temperature was neither less than 0 nor less than 15, then the else
// block would be executed.
